        <h1>Confirmed COVID-19 cases over time (from 12/31 to 04/03)</h1>
        <p>K1818715 Yuki Tatsumi</p>
        <p>I have to apologize that I made completely different thing from the report I submitted for coursework 1.
        I know this is an excuse, but there are two reasons that I want to claim. <br>
        Firstly, I needed quite a long time to settle down against this coronavirus situation, and couldn't allocate
        much time for this assignment. I went back to my country and spent the quarantine in a hotel without a free wifi.
        I wasn't able to work for any assignments during then. However I question why the deadline is not being revised
        for this module, despite all the other assignments are pushed back from two to three weeks. I feel doubtful about
        the lecturer not taking these conditions into consideration where many students are obviously suffering. <br>
        Secondly, I had some kind of an environmental issue. I was planning to plot crime locations on the map, but I
        couldn't project the map. I spent almost fully two days dealing with this, but I couldn't figure out what the problem is.
        I even downloaded some sample codes from the Internet and run them, but the map didn't show up. Therefore I decided to
        change what to do. <br>

        I appreciate if you could consider these circumstances.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Coronavirus is hitting our society.
        Starting in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus started to spread. Total number of infected people
        has surpassed 1 million worldwide on April 3rd, and the number continues to grow exponentially.
        All the countries are now scrambling to cope with this crisis. However, interestingly, the number of infection
        are shifting differently among each country, depending on their culture and government's policy.
        </p>

        <select class="country"></select>
        <div id="graph"></div>

        <h2>Results, Discussions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Visualized the transitions of the positive cases of coronavirus.</li>
            <li>China had successfully reduced the increase of infectors after 50 days.</li>
            <li>The number of positive cases in Italy had already exceeded that of China.</li>
            <li>Cases in Japan is growing slowly compared to other countries.</li>
            <li>UK might follow a similar path to Italy with 2 weeks of gap.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Plotted the shift of positive coronavirus cases by country.</li>
            <li>Could have been better to plot more than one graphs to make them comparable instead of plotting single graph for interaction.</li>
            <li>Could have plotted some of the major government policy in the graph. (didn't have enough time to do research)</li>
        </ul>
